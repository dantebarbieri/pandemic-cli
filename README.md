## OVERVIEW

In _Pandemic_, you and your fellow players are members of a disease control team. You must work together to develop cures and prevent disease outbreaks, before 4 deadly diseases (Blue, Yellow, Black, and Red) contaminate humanity.

_Pandemic_ is a *cooperative* game. The players all win or lose together.

The goal is to discover cures for all 4 diseases. The players lose if:

- 8 outbreaks occur (a worldwide pandemic happens),
- not enough disease cubes are left when needed (a disease spreads too much), or,
- not enough player cards are left when needed (your team runs out of time).

Each player has a specific role with special abilities to improve the team's chances.

## SETUP

1. Set out the board and pieces
   - Place the board within easy reach of all players. Put the 6 research stations and disease cubes nearby. Separate the cubes by color into 4 supply piles. Place 1 research station in Atlanta.
   - Atlanta is home to the CDC, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
2. Place outbreaks and cure markers
   - Place the outbreaks marker on the "0" space of the Outbreaks Track. Place the 4 cure markers, "vial" side up, near the Discovered Cure Indicators.
3. Place infection rate marker and infect 9 cities
   - Place the infection rate marker on the left-most "2" space of the Infection Rate Track. Shuffle the Infection cards and flip over 3 of them.
   - Put 3 disease cubes of the *matching* color on each of these cities.
   - Flip over 3 more cards: put 2 disease cubes on each of these cities.
   - Flip over 3 more cards: put 1 disease cube on each of these cities.
   - You will place a total of 18 disease cubes, each matching the color of the city.
   - Place these 9 cards face up on the Infection Discard Pile. The other Infection cards form the Infection Deck.
4. Give each player cards and a pawn
   - Give each player a reference card. Shuffle the Role cards and deal 1 face up in front of each player. Place the matching colored pawns for these roles in Atlanta. Remove from the game the remaining Role cards and pawns.
   - Take the Epidemic cards out of the Player Deck and set them aside until Step 5. Shuffle the other Player cards (City and Event cards). Deal cards to the players to form their initial hands. Give cards according to the number of players:

|  # of players | Cards |
| :------------ | :---: |
| 2-player game |   4   |
| 3-player game |   3   |
| 4-player game |   2   |

5. Prepare the Player Deck
   - Set the game's difficulty level, by using either 4, 5, or 6 Epidemic cards, for an Introductory, Standard, or Heroic game. Remove any unused Epidemic cards from the game.
   - Divide the remaining player cards into face down piles, as equal in size as you can, so that the number of piles matches the number of Epidemic cards you are using. Shuffle 1 Epidemic card into each pile, face down. Stack these piles to form the Player Deck, placing smaller piles on the bottom.
6. Begin play
   - The players look at the City cards they have in their hand.
   - The player with the highest City population goes first.

## PLAY

Each player turn is divided into 3 parts:

1. Do 4 actions.
2. Draw 2 Player cards.
3. Infect cities.

After a player is done infecting cities, the player on their left goes next.

Players should freely give each other advice. Let everyone offer opinions and ideas. However, the player whose turn it is decides what to do.

Your hand can have City and Event cards in it. City cards are used in some actions and Event cards can be played at any time.

## ACTIONS

You may do up to 4 actions per turn.

Select any combination of the actions listed below. You may do the same action several times, each time counting as 1 action. Your role's special abilities may change how an action is done. Some actions involve discarding a card from your hand; all these discards go to the Player Discard Pile.

### MOVEMENT ACTIONS

#### Drive / Ferry

Move to a city connected by a white line to the one you are in.

#### Direct Flight

Discard a City card to move to the city named on the card.

#### Charter Flight

Discard the City card that *matches* the city you are in to move to *any* city.

#### Shuttle Flight

Move from a city with a research station to any other city that has a research station.

### OTHER ACTIONS

#### Build a Research Station

Discard the City card that matches the city you are in to place a research station there. Take the research station from the pile next to the board. If all 6 research stations have been built, take a research station from anywhere on the board.

If more than 6 research stations were supplied, set any extra aside during setup.

#### Treat Disease

Remove 1 disease cube from the city you are in, placing it in the cube supply next to the board. If this disease color has been cured (see [Discover a Cure](#discover-a-cure) below), remove all cubes of that color from the city you are in.

If the *last* cube of a *cured disease* is removed from the board, this disease is *eradicated*. Flip its cure marker from its "vial" side to its "üö´" side.

If there are cubes from several cured diseases in a city, you must still Treat Disease once for each cured color to remove these cubes.

Eradicating a disease is not needed to win. However, when cities of an eradicated disease are infected, no new disease cubes are placed there (see Epidemics and Infections on page 6). Removing the last cube of a disease that is not cured has no effect.

#### Share Knowledge

You can do this action in two ways:

*give* the City card that matches the city you are in to another player, or

*take* the City card that matches the city you are in from another player.

The other player must also be in the city with you. Both of you need to agree to do this.

If the player who gets the card now has more than 7 cards, that player must immediately discard a card or play an Event card (see Event Cards on page 7).

#### Discover a Cure

At *any* research station, discard 5 City cards of hte same color from your hand to cure the disease *of that color*. Move the disease's cure marker to its Cure Indicator.

If no cubes of this color are on the board, this disease is now *eradicated*. Flip its cure marker from its "vial" side to its "üö´" side.

When a disease is cured, its cubes remain on the board and new cubes can still be placed during epidemics or infections (see Epidemics and Infections on page 6). However, treating this disease is now easier and you are closer to winning.

## DRAW CARDS

After doing 4 actions, draw the top 2 cards together from the Player Deck.

‚ö†Ô∏è If, as you are about to draw, there are fewer than 2 cards left in the Player Deck, the game ends and your team has lost! (Do *not* reshuffle the discards to form a new deck.)

### EPIDEMIC CARDS

If your draws include any *Epidemic* cards, immediately do the following steps in order:

1. **Increase:** Move the infection rate marker forward 1 space on the Infection Rate Track.
2. **Infect:** Draw the *bottom* card from the Infection Deck. Unless its disease color has been eradicated, put 3 disease cubes of that color on the named city. If the city already has cubes of this color, do not add 3 cubes to it. Instead, add just enough cubes so that it has 3 cubes of this color and then an *outbreak* of this disease occurs in the city (see Outbreaks below). Discard this card to the Infection Discard Pile.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you cannot place the number of cubes *actually needed on the board*, because there are not enough cubes of the needed color left in the supply, the game ends and your team has lost! This can occur during an epidemic, an outbreak, or infections (see Outbreaks and Infections below).

3. **Intensify:** Reshuffle just the cards in the Infection Discard Pile and place them on top of the Infection Deck.

‚ö†Ô∏è When doing these steps, remember to draw from the bottom of the Infection Deck and and to then
